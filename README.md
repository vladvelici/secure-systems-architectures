# BS2203 Secure Systems Architectures


Content for the BS2203 Secure Systems Architectures at the University of Winchester, 2019/2020


This repo contains a simple skeleton to get started with the coursework. It has two versions, one based on the [flask HTTP server](http://flask.palletsprojects.com) and one based on [pyro4](https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (python RPC library).


## Install dependencies

To be able to run this code you will need to install `pyro4`, `flask` and `requests` libraries. The `requirements.txt` file has the exact versions that I used to implement this, you can install them with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You can install python packages with `pip`, `easy_install` or `conda` (anaconda). Anaconda has a UI too but it can get confusing.
